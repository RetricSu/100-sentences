export const defaultText = `The Dragon Boat Festival happens on the 5th day of the 5th lunar month, usually in June. Chinese people call it 'Duanâ€‘wu Jie'. The holiday remembers a kind poet named Qu Yuan. When his country was lost, he jumped into a river in sadness.

People raced long wooden boats shaped like dragons to try to save him. Today the races are the most exciting part of the festival. Each boat has a drummer who beats a rhythm so the paddlers can row together.

Families also make and eat zongzi, sticky rice wrapped in bamboo leaves. Some put meat, peanuts, or red beans inside. Eating zongzi is said to keep bad luck away.`;
