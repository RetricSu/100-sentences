I understand the issue is still not resolved. Let me document the requirements and desired behavior clearly for future implementation.

## Dictation Mode Requirements & Desired Behavior

### Core Problem
The dictation mode currently has a bug where user input gets cleared when:
1. Clicking on the same sentence again to hear it
2. Clicking on a different sentence

### Expected Behavior

#### 1. **Input Persistence**
- When a user types text in dictation mode, that input should be **permanently saved** for that specific sentence
- Clicking on the same sentence multiple times should **never clear** the typed text
- The input should persist even when the component unmounts/remounts

#### 2. **Sentence Navigation**
- When clicking on a **different sentence**, the previous sentence's input should be **preserved**
- The new sentence should start with its own saved input (if any) or empty input
- Each sentence maintains its own independent input state

#### 3. **Audio Reference**
- Clicking on any sentence should **always play the audio** regardless of dictation state
- Audio playback should **not interfere** with the dictation input
- Users should be able to hear the sentence multiple times while typing

#### 4. **User Experience Flow**
1. User enters dictation mode
2. User clicks on sentence A → starts typing → input saved
3. User clicks on sentence A again → audio plays, input preserved
4. User clicks on sentence B → input for A preserved, B starts with its saved input (if any)
5. User returns to sentence A → sees their previous input exactly as they left it

#### 5. **Testing Scenarios**
- [ ] Type in sentence A, click sentence A again → input preserved
- [ ] Type in sentence A, click sentence B → A's input preserved, B starts fresh
- [ ] Type in sentence A, type in sentence B, return to A → both inputs preserved
- [ ] Audio plays correctly without affecting input
- [ ] Component unmounts/remounts without losing state
- [ ] Multiple rapid clicks on same sentence → input never clears

This implementation should provide a seamless dictation experience where users can freely navigate between sentences and replay audio without losing their progress.
