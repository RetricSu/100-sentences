Emo Girl,,"Emo Girl\r\n\r\nAn emo girl is a girl who likes to dress in emo fashion, has an emo(tional) personality and listens to emo music. (Such as Bright Eyes.)  Emo girls like to hang out with other emo girls and emo boys.  They are usually sad most of the time, do not smile very often, and just like emo boys, show no signs of self worth or self confidence whatsoever and will not make eye contact with you. \r\n\r\nAn emo girl has very dark hair, either cut somewhere around their shoulder, or in the classic emo haircut, which is sort of short and spiky in the back with long sweeping bangs in the front.  Their hair has to be very dark brown or black, or in some cases very light blonde as long as the cut is right.  No matter what, it must be worn so that it is covering part of their face at all times.  This is because emo girls tend to be shy and mysterious and don’t really want their face to show too much.  They usually wear a lot of dark eyeliner and tend to have washed out skin. \r\n\r\nMost emo girls are vegetarians or vegans. Although some girls just dress in the emo style, most emo girls are sad; cry and write poetry a lot, and tend to cut their wrists.  They usually hide this by wearing armbands or lots of happy colored bracelets.  \r\n\r\nTheir clothing consists of tight jeans, converse and dark colored tight shirts.  They also might have a scarf on.  They may a few have pins from shows on their jeans.  They usually have at least a few piercings and wear lots of happy colored jewelry.  Some wear horn rimmed glasses, some do not.   They really don’t like it if you confuse them with a goth. Emo and goth are very different so don’t make this mistake. \r\n\r\nThey are most likely to be seen at shows, looking completely sad and lost.  Emo girls also love it when emo boys make out with each other (which they tend to do a lot).      \r\n \r\nJust like Emo boys, they usually walk with their head down not making eye contact with anyone.  Although most Emo kids are very sad and feel like the world hates them, they tend to understand what other Emo kids are going through.\n> That girl over there in the corner with the dark hair, listening to Bright Eyes, and staring at the floor must be emo.\n",,,,,,0,0,,,

Eric Holder - Attorney General,,"Eric Holder is a perfect example of a token puppet nigger appointed to the position of U.S. Attorney General that functions as dictated by a racially biased, self-serving, administration that will not uphold the law with respect to any legal issue that may reflect negatively on blacks, whom they rely on to further their political agenda(s). At the time of this writing, two major issues face this scum sucking moolie. The first being the refusal to pursue black on white crime as 'hate' crime, even though it is obvious to everybody that this was the motive. The second is the 'Fast and Furious' scandal that ultimately helped cause the deaths of law enforcement personnel. The agenda here being the false argument in favor of banning semi-automatic firearms, claiming they are falling into the hands of criminals across the border. This of course they would hope would open the flood gates to still more forms of gun control in an attempt to disarm the American public.\n> That shitstain Eric Holder - Attorney General is refusing to present documents relating to the Fast and Furious scandal to congress. I hope they don't just nail the spook for contempt, but throw his worthless watermelon ass in the slammer with some Aryan Brotherhood folks.

fanfiction,,"I noticed most of the other definitions here completely trash fanfiction.\r\n\r\nFirst, definition: Fanfiction is when someone takes either the story or characters (or both) of a certain piece of work, whether it be a novel, tv show, movie, etc, and create their own story based on it. Sometimes people will take characters from one movie and put them in another, which is called a [cross-over].\r\n\r\nMost people who bash fanfiction are not willing to look past the fact that it's based on something else to see that it could be worth reading IF you like the subject. If they don't like the subject, then obviously they are going to automatically dismiss the fanfiction.\r\n\r\nIt is true, however, that some fanfictions are rather poorly written and only a few hundred words, and it is also true that some people just write them so they can have their favorite characters have sex ([lemon]). But, if you take the time to find something decent, you can end up with a fanfiction story that is so close to the original piece of art, that you'd barely notice the difference.\n> Mary decided to write a fanfiction based on a story she had read. She liked the idea of two of the characters as a couple, but it wasn't in the original plot, so she twisted the story around a bit and evolved the characters so that it seemed as though they actually *could* have been together in the first place. (Good example, it's rare that someone does it perfectly but there are some out there)\n> Sue was so angry that her two favorite characters never got together that she wrote her own story in which the first thing they did was have sex and get married.

Children do not have spectacularly large breasts, but they can be nice ones. \r\n\r\nAs for women, their is no such thing as a flat-chested no-breasted woman - at least in professional hentai anyway. Their breasts are perfect and natural - not tainted by surgery with scars and abnormalness. They are perfect. Hentai is perfection.\r\n\r\nAs for elderly women, they do not exist. In hentai, they do not get naked. They are characters that are basically asexual to the hentai nature. Thank god. \r\n\r\nHentai can involve anything sexual. Lesbians, bisexuals, homosexuals, bondage, underwater, fairies, humans and animals, orgies, oral sex, [aural] sex, anal sex, naisal sex, S&M, slavery, dildos, strap-ons, anal toys and of course heterosexual vaginal sex. Hentai isn't always sexual penetration with a group or pair of people. It can be a woman/man/tranny posing or masturbating. It could be a group kissing or undressing or fondling each other. \r\n\r\nHentai has no limits. That is why it is so great. I have nothing against real pornography, I enjoy it also.

An Indie Kid is, by no mean shape or form, a scenester. \r\n\r\nIndie Boys tend to be skinny, shy, with messy hair and a fringe. The hair must not be confused with emo hair, which is styled using disturbing quantaties of gel, wax, mousse and hairspray. Indie boys just can't be arsed to brush. Skinny jeans are more typical of the [scene kid], Indie boys prefer fairly loose fitting denim. A plain t-shirt or shirt are very popular, along with ancient battered converse, in black or blue.\r\n\r\nIndie Girls normally have wavy hair that looks bedraggled, and dress not a million miles away from the boys, just with more feminine styles. Indie Girls generally don't really care about their appearence that much, but scrub up pretty darn well, as opposed to a [scene girl] who is the scum off the earth. Indie girls wear any sort of jeans, comfy and casual t-shirts and the same footwear as the boys.\r\n\r\nAnother important difference between Indie Kids and [scene kids] is that indie kids are actually capable of having nice conversations with the bands they meet, as opposed to the scenester ego-boosting and myspace photo posing. \r\n\r\nIndie kids are friendly, cheerful and actually suprisingly non-elitest; I, as an Indie Kid(ette, maybe, as a girl) have many a time got down to the funky sounds of Snoop Dogg.

The term is a combination of the word 'keyboard' (the main tool by which the person expresses his/her latent rage) and 'warrior' (due to the warrior-like aggression, tendency towards violence, headstrong nature and propensity towards brute force as a means of resolving conflict rather than more subtle means dependant on finesse).\r\n3. The Keyboard Warrior seeks to use the power imbued in his 'weapon' to effect death and destruction (in a strictly-metaphorical sense) upon his foes (other virtual identities he has encountered on the internet). In essence, the keyboard (ie. text input ability) allows the keyboard warrior to manifest his true warrior nature in a safe and removed environment, from which no real-life repercussions .\r\n4.

lesbian sex,,"So in answer to the question How do lesbians have sex? the answer is simple. Like everyone else, it all falls under personal preference. Sex is really such a personal and intimate act that no one answer would fit for everyone, but here are a few particulars to consider ... \r\n\r\nBODIES. We sometimes forget that the entire body is an erogenous zone. Sensitive areas include the face, ears, neck, arms, chest, belly, back, butt, and thighs, back of knees, calves, feet and toes. The entire body can be used to excite a woman. Rubbing bodies together, feeling erect nipples or moist pubic area can excite with subtle motions. \r\n\r\nFINGERS. Fingers can be delightful to use on those women who enjoy penetration (not all women do). Some women appreciate long, thin fingers while others like the feel of short, strong fingers. No matter what the preference, all women appreciate clean, short, well-filed nails. \r\n\r\nHANDS. Running hands up and down a lover's body will often elicit electric responses of passion. From light caresses down the back to deep rubbing across the butt, caressing is an important aspect to sex. Caressing often turns to gentle pinching or tugging at nipples. Lightly running fingers in a tickling motion across the belly and sides will excite many women. Once excitement has built, slipping fingers into the vagina or rubbing against the clitoris will often bring a woman to orgasm. \r\n\r\nMOUTH. Kissing is a good place to begin and a very important part of sex. Kisses come in different styles depending on the person, the mood and the moment. Tiny, soft kisses tantalize and intrigue. Deep, open-mouth kisses with tongues entwined convey a depth of passion and longing. Kisses are appropriate for any part of the body, wherever one feels the urge to place them, lightly or with trailing tongues. Gently nibbling or sucking on nipples excites some women, and some women can reach orgasm just from breast arousal. It is important to note reactions to these stimulations as some women dislike having their breasts touched at all. Gently nibbling or sucking on a responsive clitoris is enjoyed by most women and most often results in orgasm.\r\n\r\nPELVIC AREA. Some women can reach orgasm by rubbing pelvic areas together or against a lover's leg. This can be done with one partner on top or two women side-to-side.\r\n\r\nANAL SEX. Anal sex can include anilingus (licking the anus) and/or penetration. Penetration can be done with a finger or fingers, dildo or butt plug. Some women love anal sex, others do not. Like everything else, it's all personal preference. \r\n\r\nDILDOS, VIBRATORS & BUTT PLUGS. (Or objects used to vaginal or anal penetration). Some women use dildos and/or butt plugs some do not. Some use them occasionally; some use them all the time. Dildos come in many different shapes, colors and sizes. Some are shaped as corncobs, fists, dolphins or fingers. Some have attachments to stimulate the clitoris during penetration and some have two ends to stimulate two women at one time. It's all personal preference. \r\n\r\nFISTING. Fisting is penetrating a woman's vagina with your entire hand. Fisting requires a lot of concentration and caution. I recommend Hand In The Bush: The Fine Art of Vaginal Fisting, by Deborah Addington, if you want to learn the proper how-to on fisting. \r\n\r\nMUTUAL MASTURBATION. Many women enjoy mutual masturbation. Lying while facing each other, simultaneously rubbing and touching each other's clitoris can be educational as well as enjoyable.\n> The two chicks had hot lesbian sex all night using dildos, fingers, mouth, n toys\n",,,,,,0,0,,,

Libtard,,"As repetitive as it sounds, it stands for ""liberal retard.""\r\n\r\nA libtard wants to live in a fantasy world (in which life is the way that they WISH IT WAS) as opposed to dealing with life the way it actually is.  \r\n\r\n(This explains the religious fervor that many of them demonstrate when it comes to smoking pot).\r\n\r\nThe most idealistic libtard envisions a time when science/technology and Socialism will eliminate all poverty, hunger, war, disease, injustice, unemployment and prejudice. (It is a nice [pipe dream] but human nature will forever stand in the way of that goal).\r\n\r\nMost libtards subscribe to the notion that ""people are basically good"", and build their foundation for activism and ""improving the human condition"" on that faulty premise. Because they deny the facts about human nature, their ""reasoning"" is diametrically opposite to common sense (blue states vs. red states).\r\n\r\nThe reality that people have different initiative levels, are basically selfish, and often work for their own interests before helping others, puts a libtard's [panties in a wad]. So, when citizens will not voluntarily comply with various libtard prescriptions for ""the common good"", then laws must be passed, or force used, to MAKE them comply. (It is the gradual path to totalitarianism).\r\n\r\nLikewise, his/her naïve cries of: ""can't we all just get along?"" and ""there is nothing worth dying for"" are red flags for anyone with a clue.\r\n\r\nMetaphorically speaking, a libtard is a sheep who thinks that their grasp of diplomatic nuance or metaphysical sensitivity will prevent their flock from being devoured by the world's Islamic/Communist wolves. When America, the sheep dog, responds to wolf attacks, the libtard judges these defensive actions as offensive and wolfish.\r\n\r\nSince libtards are unable to recognize our enemies for what they are, they cannot be trusted to safeguard our future.\r\n\r\n>>>>>\r\n\r\nIn a large nutshell, a libtard's goal in life includes one or more of the following:\r\n\r\n--the establishment of a Socialist ""utopia"" (a.k.a. a global [nanny state])\r\n--""benevolent"" totalitarian control of the world's population through any means necessary\r\n--ever increasing government micromanagement of private enterprise (a.k.a. clueless meddling)\r\n--the adoption of laws, treaties and tax regulations that hinder America's competitiveness\r\n--the usurpation of the legislative process, at all levels, through judicial fiat\r\n--the filing of specious law suits in order to thwart the will of the people (e.g. Calif. Proposition. 187)\r\n--the promotion of the tyranny of the minority\r\n--the filing of specious law suits to shakedown corporations for cash (under the guise of ""social responsibility"")\r\n--the disproportionate taxation of citizens ""who have more money than they need""\r\n--the redistribution of wealth from producers to non-producers (under the guise of ""fairness"")\r\n--the banning and confiscation of all privately owned guns (even though it has lead to genocide)\r\n--the abolition of all private property rights\r\n--the destruction of all national sovereignty (America first, of course)\r\n--the destruction of Capitalism\r\n--the establishment of one religion (with no personal accountability), OR the abolition of all religion\r\n--the appeasement of Islamic radicals and their American front groups like CAIR (see: [Religion of Pieces])\r\n--the regulation, or banning, of all opposition media (under the guise of ""fairness"")\r\n--the appeasement of Communist dictators and their American front groups\r\n--the further insertion of Socialist ideology and indoctrination into public school curricula\r\n--the purposeful ""dumbing down"" of the masses through inane public school curricula and pedagogy\r\n--mass thought control through ""speech codes"" and [political correctness]\r\n--the further promulgation of the homosexual/pedophile agenda\r\n--the teaching of HATE (superficially disguised as ""Women's Studies"", ""African Studies"", etc.)\r\n--the legalization of marijuana (""far OUT, man"")\r\n--the establishment of world wide socialized medicine (under the guise of ""fairness"")\r\n--the conservation of the environment over the conservation of the American economy\r\n--the demonization of attempts to make English America’s national language\r\n--world peace (which genocidal dictators define as: ""the absence of conflict""--dead men cannot resist your brutal oppression)\r\n--the conservation of the environment over the conservation of humanity\r\n--the promotion of abortion as birth control, eugenics, and teaching the theory of evolution as fact (even though the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics precludes it from the get-go)\r\n--the abolition of individual freedom\r\n--anarchy\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, there is a thread of anti-Americanism that runs through these ideas. A libtard cannot stomach the idea that America, despite its faults, is the greatest country in the world. As such, he/she sees it as their duty to tarnish the country's current and past image using all available means including: cherry picking facts and using innuendo, half-truths, lies and fabrications (see: [Rathergate]).\r\n\r\nLibtards’ actions undermine America's educational system, economy, criminal justice system, military personnel, sovereignty, security, and freedoms. Meanwhile, they try to fabricate a moral equivalence with rogue nations like China, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria, Somalia and Sudan. (But don't question their patriotism).\r\n\r\nNOTE TO ALL MALCONTENTS: If America is truly evil, please pick yourself a better country.\r\n\r\nIf the health care system in Cuba, Canada or Great Britain is superior to America's, then you are free to leave. If the crime rate in China, North Korea or the [Magic Kingdom] is so much lower, then you too are free to leave. Not enough hedonism for you? Then try Amsterdam, Bangkok or Tijuana.\r\n\r\nIf life in general is better in Sweden, The Netherlands or Switzerland then WHY are you still here??? You talk big, but you lack the courage of your convictions. So do humanity a favor--shut up and move away.\r\n\r\nOtherwise get a real job, and get a life, because you obviously have WAY too much time on your hands.\r\n\r\n>>>>>\r\n\r\nBecause most libtards are pantheists (New Agers), agnostics, atheists, liberal Jews, liberal Catholics, or have otherwise turned their backs on Jehovah, they lack true spiritual fulfillment. In order to try and fill that void, and ""to make a difference"", they work for the causes listed above. A pretty complete listing can be found at discoverthenetworks.org.\r\n\r\nA libtard will participate in protests, rallies, marches, bike rides, etc. in a feckless attempt to change whatever supposedly needs changing (see: [muckadoo]). Their desire to revisit the ""glory"" days of the 60's is sometimes a driving force. Regardless, the end result is usually the same: nothing actually changes.\r\n\r\nBut, since a libtard wants to be rated for his/her good intentions, versus actual results, they leave these activities with a feeling of success ""because they have raised awareness"" or ""let their voices be heard."" Post-protest gatherings often feature excessive drinking, drug abuse, and impromptu fornication to celebrate the ""victory."" \r\n\r\nBecause conservatives take responsibility for themselves and their children, have real jobs, under gird the economy, and value their time, their counter protesting is often negligible.\r\n\r\nIt is not that they don't care about their causes; they just understand that 1968 tactics are useless. Likewise, their sense of self worth does not come from how well they perform at work, or in life, but from a realization that they have been given a good and satisfying destiny that no one can take away.\r\n\r\nWith all of this in mind, may we NOW question a libtard's patriotism???\n> “You are listening to CNN, the Communist News Network.”\n> Anchorman: “Good morning, I’m E. Feet Liberal. Our top story, disastrous former mayor of Cleveland, Dennis Cucinich, has been appointed to head the newly created Department of Rainbows, Unicorns and Dandelions. When told of his appointment, Cucinich remarked,\n> ‘As former ambassador to the Crab Nebula, I am looking forward to bringing my diplomatic expertise to the problem of terrorist, er, civilly challenged attacks on our planet.

Secretary Cucinich wasted no time in convening a meeting with top terrorist, er, civilly challenged leaders and their fellow travelers from CAIR.

Let’s listen in.”\n> Cucinich: “There there Abdul, why don’t we all take a ten minute break and go to our ‘happy places’?”\n> Terrorist, er, Civilly Challenged heathen: “You're a clueless libtard. Death to those who insult Islam!”\n> Cucinich: “Now now Abdul, I know that the civilly challenged have legitimate grievances, but America has a Band-Aid big enough for any third world boo boo. Hey what’s that under your dirty nightshirt?”\n> KA-BOOOOOOM!!!\n> Womyn Reporter: “Oh my Gaia! That man just detonated an explosive vest. He must have been a Mossad agent. I’ll try and get a comment from CAIR’s spokeswhore. Excuse me sir, was this the work of Israeli intelligence?”\n> CAIR Spokeswhore: “Of course it was you decadent whore! And how dare you show your ankle in public! Now kneel down and receive your beating.”\n> Womyn Reporter: “But I thought Islam was the Religion of Peace!”\n> CAIR Spokeswhore: “It IS. And if you call us violent, we’ll kill you!”\n> Womyn Reporter: “Can we stand in a circle and sing Kumbayah?”\n> CAIR Spokeswhore: (smacks forehead) “ALLAH no!”\n> Womyn Reporter: “Can’t we all just get along?”\n> CAIR Spokeswhore: “Yes, when you’re dead.”\n> Womyn Reporter: (backing up) “Stay away from me you seventh century, scum-sucking pig dog, and put DOWN that scimitar!

Lymtudor,,"To lymtudor is to smoke human flesh.  It has been known throughout history to have been done, but as of June 27, 2008, no one had ever come up with a name for it, but the ""eating fanatics"" and ""anti-smoking"" liberal activist judges did make a word for eating human flesh, clearly showing the corrupt cannibal lobbyists in the United States Senate.\r\n\r\n== History ==\r\nThroughout history, many important leaders and historical figures have been known to have been lymtudors.  Some examples are [[Rene Descartes]], [[Johan Gutenberg]], and [[Hester Prynne]].  \r\n\r\n== Side Effects ==\r\nThe side effects include most notably the inexplicable urge to build model bridges.  This can be equated to a well known issue referred to as the ""munchies"" often experienced by partakers of marijuana.  Some lymtudors experience rare side effects such as the femurs turning into melted cheddar and pepper jack cheese.  Also some may go unconscious and wake up in Asia wearing a human lung as a hat or [[cephalapleuring]].\r\n\r\n==Narcitudors==\r\nNarcitudors are a sub-branch of lymtudors who are known to enjoy only smoking their own flesh.  Many [[witches]] are part of this subculture and would often commit crimes in order to force the townspeople to burn them at the stake.  Also, [[Joan of Arc]] was a well known lymtudor and built a pyre on which she could burn herself and inhale her burning flesh.  The [[Buddhist monks in Saigon]] were also very well known narcitudors as they decided to protest the United State's banning of lymtudor grade flesh in the city.\r\n\r\n==Contributions to society==\r\nLymtudors are used in most new construction.  This is done when project managers create huge oversized bridges anywhere, and hope that lymtudors will construct the model sized bridges, which will be the size that was intended, in the correct location, so as to save on labor costs.  The quality of these bridges are very poor as they are only made of balsa wood and super glue and well over pi squared people have been injured in lymtudor constructed bridge collapses.\n> I knew a man who smoked three shylocks, and constructed nineteen model bridges in an hour once.

mudkips,,"Mudkips were coolly brought to the 4chan table of love when this story with Copypasta-ed onto the site.\r\n\r\nToday being Halloween, I decided to fuck with the major retard at school when I came out of science for break. He was dressed as Ash. Knowing this was going to happen, I brough a Mudkips doll. Thus I started the conversation, making sure no one saw me.\r\n\r\n""So I heard you like Mudkips..."" ""Mudkips? I LUUUUUUUUUUUUVE MUDKIPS."" ""O RLY? So, would you ever fuck a Mudkips, that is.."" (he cuts me off before I could said 'if you were a mudkips') ""OF COURSE."" ""Well I just happen to have a Mudkips here, and.""\r\n\r\nBefore I finished the sentence, which would have resulted in me hitting him across the face with the doll, he grabbed it. In one swift motion his pants were down and he was violenly humping it. Not to get between a man and his Mudkips I started to walk away, because there is no way I'd be caught wrestling a half-naked crazy guy humping a Mudkips.\r\n\r\nNeedles to say, within 5 to 10 seconds, some girls saw him and started screaming. I cooly walked into a restroom, pretending nothing had ever happened; not that I had intended that outcome, but now that it was in play I didn't want to be involved.\r\n\r\nI came back two minutes later, and like any wanton act on school grounds there was now a huge crowd round him. He was still fucking it and baying this real fucked up 'EEEEEEEEEEINNNNF EEEEEEEEEEINNNF' sound. Suddenly a scuffle broke out in the middle, meaning he probably did something stupid.\r\n\r\nI asked someone what had happened. A girlfriend of one of the football players tried to get him to stop, but he bit her for trying to take it away. Someone called in a few football players (all dressed up like Road Warrior) who proceeded to pummel the shit out of the guy. Meanwhile the school police were freaking out and having trouble getting in to the situation.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the intruder alarm went off and we were shuffled into classrooms. Over the intercom the principal announced that someone had thrown a flaming plush toy into the library. Uh.. what the hell.\r\n\r\nSo we were kept there and about 30 minutes later the principal came on again. This time he was saying that whoever was behind the beating should turn themselves in. All of a sudden this woman began yelling ""I WILL SUE YOU FOR DAMAGES. YOU LITTLE PUNKS, I'M GONNA SUE..."" and it was cut off.\r\n\r\nI asked an office later what had happened. Apparently his mother had come to pick him up and threatened to sue for the beating and 'whatever else happened.' The school threatened to counter-sue because of lewd conduct, inciting a riot, and starting a fight.\r\n\r\nSo I ask you: do you like Mudkips? \n> I hath heardth that thou liketh kips of the mud.\n> Mudkips.

narutard,,"Narutard is a derogatory term applied to otaku fans of the anime title Naruto. It is a word play on the combination of naruto and retard. This term surfaced during early 2004 at the beginning of the anime's popularity in America and characterizes the behavior of Naruto fans as being so blindly devoted to the series (with an almost religious cult-like fervor) that they act incredibly stupid and can be confused with retarded (er, mentally challenged) persons.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly seen on internet forums and chat services such as IRC, where the Naruto series is a constant source of debate. Many narutards dress as their favorite character during conventions or festivals to display their metal head bands, which are worn by characters in the series as a sign of gang affiliation. One characteristic of a narutard is that they will wear just a head band over their street clothes and tell everyone that they are cosplaying. Serious cosplayers who wear costumes that cost hundreds of dollars in raw materials and took weeks to construct generally consider narutards to be anywhere from merely ignorant to downright insulting.\r\n\r\nWith the license acquisition of Naruto in early 2005 by ShoPro Entertainment, many narutards spawned numerous forum discussions debating the impact of the deal, from the legality of trafficking amateur subtitled copies of the title (something which should be pretty obvious, especially once American distribution rights had been acquired) to a grass-roots petition begging Cartoon Network and ShoPro / Viz to retain the full integrity of the anime during its adaptation into English. However, as with many Japanese series adapted into English, there are legal and other issues which often make it difficult if not impossible to produce a rendition faithful enough to appease purists.\r\n\r\nMost narutards are, unsurprisingly, also purists when it comes to adapting Naruto into English. Allegedly, a few narutards boasted of their intention to engage in physical vandalism, DDoS, and other assaults toward ShoPro and Cartoon Network. Other alleged proposals included a petition and hunger strike camping out in front of these companies' offices\n> ""naruto is the best anime in the world""\n> ""naruto rocks""\n",,,,,,0,0,,,

Ocarina of Time,,"The sole greatest Legend of Zelda game in existence, and therefore the greatest video game in existence as well.\n\nDeveloped for the Nintendo 64 and released on November 23, 1998, this was the first time we saw a 3D Zelda game. It won the 1999 Game of the Year award. It has held the #1 spot on GameRankings.com for over a decade.\n\nPreorders of the game were received with a gold cartridge, whereas off-the-shelf versions were received with the standard gray carts seen on most N64 titles. The two styles of carts bear few differences in gameplay, only in the changing of Ganondorf's blood from red to green, the removal of an Islamic chant from the Fire Temple's background music, as well as the fixing of a few reported glitches in gameplay.\n\nOcarina of Time spawned a single direct sequel, Majora's Mask in 2000, which takes place after Ocarina of Time's child timeline. This would be the last time we would see a realistic style Zelda game until Twilight Princess in 2006.\n\nOcarina of Time has been subsequently re-released on the GameCube on a promotional disc for preordering WindWaker, as well as on a Collector's disc featuring The Legend of Zelda, Adventure of Link, and Majora's Mask that was bundled with new GameCubes. It has also been released on the Wii's Virtual Console, retaining all but its rumble ability. These versions are based on the gray cart versions of the game.\n\nOcarina of Time has set a new standard for adventure games that has yet to be topped.\n> There aren't enough words in any language to describe how awesome Ocarina of Time is.\n",,,,,,0,0,,,

Operation Chaos,,"Injecting that time-honored, sauce-for-the-goose principle into 2008 democrat politics, talk show host Rush Limbaugh goaded Texas and Ohio Republicans to cross over and cast their primary ballots for Hillary.

And (off camera) Hillary cheered.\r\n\r\nNow they're in a real pickle. The democrat electorate, like schmucks duped by the [barnum effect], chose an unvetted nominee with a snowball's chance in Kenya of winning the general election. But if the party's Superdelegates override the voters in the hope of a November win, many blacks will surely revolt and assure a democrat defeat.\n> A classic pincer movement, Limbaugh's Operation Chaos ensnared Democrats in a battle pitting the politics of genitalia against the politics of skin pigmentation.\n> Thanks to Operation Chaos, whoever wins, Democrats lose.\n",,,,,,0,0,,,

In the majority of cases, it is because their beliefs fly in the face of rational, critical thinking and tend to fall apart very quickly under hard scrutiny.

This takes a variety of forms, such as a tendency to ascribe positive aspects of the human personality as something only unique to Otherkin. ""Mundanes"", the rest of humanity who do not share their beliefs or are simply unaware of them, are looked down upon as inferior brutes.\r\n\r\nOtherkin often exhibit certain personality traits common to dissociative disorders and manic depression.
